## üì• Installation

### Option 1: Using ComfyUI Manager

1.  Install [ComfyUI Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) if you don't have it already.
2.  Open ComfyUI, go to the **Manager** tab.
3.  Click on **Install Custom Nodes**.
4.  Search for "**ComfyUI-MagnifyGlass**" and click **Install**.
5.  Restart ComfyUI.

### Option 2: Manual Installation

```bash
cd /path/to/ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/AEmotionStudio/ComfyUI-MagnifyGlass.git
```

Restart ComfyUI after installation. No additional `pip install` steps are typically required for JavaScript-based extensions.

## üöÄ Usage

1.  **Activation**:
    - By default, press and hold `Alt + X` to activate the magnifying glass.
    - The activation key and whether `Alt/Option` is required can be changed in the settings.
2.  **Using the Magnifier**:
    - While active, move your mouse over the ComfyUI canvas to see the magnified view.
    - If `Follow Cursor` is disabled, the magnifier will remain where it was activated.
3.  **Controls (while active)**:
    - **Arrow Keys**: Nudge the magnified view (adjusts `offsetX`/`offsetY`).
    - **Shift + Arrow Keys**: Nudge the magnified view by a larger step.
    - **Reset Key (default 'R')**: Resets `offsetX` and `offsetY` to zero. (Configurable, may require Alt/Option).
4.  **Configuration**:
    - Access all settings by clicking the ‚öôÔ∏è (Settings) icon in ComfyUI, then find the "üîç Magnify Glass" section.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

-   **Magnifier not appearing**:
    -   Ensure you are pressing the correct activation key combination (check settings for current keys).
    -   Make sure ComfyUI has focus.
    -   Check the browser console (F12) for any errors related to "ComfyUI Magnifying Glass".
-   **Performance issues on very complex graphs**:
    -   While WebGL is used for efficiency, extremely complex scenes might still impact performance. Try reducing the `Glass Size` if issues occur.
-   **Text in widgets not sharp enough**:
    -   The HTML overlay feature aims to render text crisply. If you notice issues, ensure your browser zoom is at 100%.
